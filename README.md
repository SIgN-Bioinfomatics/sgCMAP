# sgCMAP
sgCMAP is an R package that implements the Connectivity Map (CMAP) algorithm developed in Broad Institute (https://www.broadinstitute.org/connectivity-map-cmap).

We provide the R scripts here for people prefer to source the R scripts directly. 

We have planned to make the R package availble too. We will update here when the it is ready.
