# sgCMAP
sgCMAP is an R package that implements the Connectivity Map (CMAP) algorithm developed in Broad Institute (https://www.broadinstitute.org/connectivity-map-cmap). The R package was developed by the Bioinformatics group at Singpore Immunology Network (SIgN), A*STAR, Singapore.

We provide the R scripts here for people who prefer to source the R scripts directly. 

We have planned to make the R package availble too. We will update here when the it is ready.
